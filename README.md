Probabilistic split point decision trees
Transparency in a machine learning model is not, by itself, sufficient for
trust, particularly in fields like medicine. One way to engender trust in a learning
system would be to enable end-users to reconcile the results with their domain
knowledge. In this research, we introduce a modified version of decision trees called
Probabilistic Split Point Decision Trees (PSPDTs). Our approach improves the
transparency and believability of decision trees by building a variant of Consolidated
Decision Trees (CDTs) using a combination of the Consolidated Tree Construction
algorithm (CTC) and a bootstrapping approach to rule induction. PSPDTs aim to
be a learning model algorithm that (at least) maintains accuracy while increasing
stability and transparency, better reflecting real-world factors, and being honest with
the uncertainty involved. By doing so, PSPDTs help to increase trust in decision trees.
This thesis examines the validity of the mathematical assumption underlying PSPDTs
and compares the accuracy of an initial PSPDT implementation to more traditional
decision tree induction algorithms.
